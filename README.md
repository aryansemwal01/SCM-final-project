We are working on a memory card game using html, css and javascript.
Description -
The memory card game, also called Concentration, involves flipping over cards to find matching pairs. Players take turns revealing two cards at a time. If the cards match, the player keeps them and goes again; if not, the cards are turned back over. The game ends when all pairs are found, and the player with the most pairs wins.
