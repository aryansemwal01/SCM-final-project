    <h1>ABOUT US :</h1>
    <p>
        A Memory Card Game, often known as Concentration or Pairs, is a classic and simple yet engaging card game that challenges players' memory and concentration skills. The game typically consists of a set of cards with identical pairs of images or symbols, all shuffled and placed face-down on a table. Players take turns flipping two cards at a time, attempting to find matching pairs. If they succeed, those cards are removed from the table. If not, the cards are flipped face-down again, and the next player takes their turn. The game continues until all pairs have been matched. Memory card games are not only fun and entertaining but also offer cognitive benefits, such as improving memory and concentration. It's a game that can be enjoyed by individuals of all ages and is often used as an educational tool for children to develop cognitive skills. We have taken inspiration from the games below to make our game more interesting and appealing.

        Purble Pairs
        Purble Pairs is a pattern recognition and memory game similar to Concentration. The object is to clear the tableau in the fewest turns. As the skill level progresses, a timer appears, the grid size increases, and more similar pictures are used. The Beginner level has one 5x5 grid, Intermediate has two 6x6 grids, and Advanced has four 8x8 grids to solve per game (shamrocks, hearts, smiley faces or gumdrops). In addition to a jester that automatically finds another match of an exposed card, numerous special pairs are present in the higher levels, such as a card of the cake batter station in Comfy Cakes that shuffles the board when paired, a clock that adds more time to the timer, and a Comfy Cakes chef that automatically finds and matches pairs of cards containing cakes. A Sneak Peek coin bonus allows the player to expose all remaining cards for a couple of seconds, but every card exposed in this way is counted as a turn. This game is not available in Purble Place v0.4, an early version from 2005. Purble Place Game link to download: <a href="https://purble-place.en.softonic.com/"> Purble Place </a>
